# DiseasePredictionFromSymptoms

This project focuses on developing a disease prediction system using advanced Machine Learning algorithms, particularly Naive Bayes and Decision Tree models.

**User Interaction:** Integrated a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a chatbot to enhance user experience, allowing users to input symptoms and receive disease predictions along with recommended treatments.

**Data Utilization:** Leveraged a comprehensive dataset containing disease symptoms, descriptions, and treatments to train the models, achieving high accuracy in predictions that facilitate early disease detection and intervention.

**Skills Used**
- Machine Learning (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees)
- Data Analysis
- GUI Development
- Chatbot Integration
- Predictive Modeling
